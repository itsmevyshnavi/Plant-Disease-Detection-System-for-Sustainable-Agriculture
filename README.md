**ðŸŒ¿ Plant Disease Detection System for Sustainable Agriculture**

---

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
I'm Vyshnavi, and I'm currently exploring how Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can help in identifying plant diseases from leaf images â€” a project aimed at supporting sustainable agriculture with the power of AI. 

Project Overview:   
This project is a Machine Learning-based Plant Disease Detection System that uses image classification to detect diseases in plants by analyzing leaf patterns.
It's a work-in-progress built as part of my learning journey during an internship. I'm combining deep learning techniques (CNN) with a user-friendly Python interface to create something impactful and accessible.

Technologies Used:  
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- Streamlit (for creating a simple, interactive web interface)
- Jupyter Notebook (for development and experimentation)

Project Features:  
* Image classification using CNNs for multiple plant diseases
* A simple frontend using Streamlit to upload and analyze leaf images
* Focused on scalability and real-world usability in the agricultural domain
* Designed with sustainability and accessibility in mind

Vision:  
To make plant disease diagnosis more accessible, affordable, and accurate through AI, thereby helping farmers take timely action and reduce crop loss, all while promoting sustainable agricultural practices.
