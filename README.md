# Plant-Disease-Detection-System-for-Sustainable-Agriculture

Hey! I'm currently learning about CNNs and how they can be used for plant disease detection.

Right now, Iâ€™ve just uploaded my Week 1 progress in the form of a PDF (`Week1.pdf`), which explains the idea and steps I plan to follow.

This project is still in its very early stages, and Iâ€™ll keep updating this repo as I learn and build more.

Thanks for visiting! ðŸŒ±
